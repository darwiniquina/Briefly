## Use Case / Scenario

Imagine a client sends over a wall of text describing their needs for a brand refresh or marketing campaign. Instead of manually formatting and summarizing it, your team can:

1. **Create a new brief** – Input the basic information and client notes.
2. **Generate structured output** – Assembly AI parses the text into a clean, structured format.
3. **Review and edit** – Refine the automatically generated brief.
4. **Track multiple briefs** – See all briefs in the page, filter by status, type, and etc.

This workflow saves time, reduces errors, and ensures your team is always aligned with client expectations.
